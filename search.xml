They believe that Internet produces nothing but academic trash. However, according to the real situation and proper deduction, the Internet certainly could, even should be the assistant of researchers nowadays. In this essay several reasons are put forward.</p>
<p>The dissenters may doubt that the use of Internet diminish the concentration of the scholars, who ought to create knowledge with enormous effort instead of seeking for a shortcut. In fact this argue is a thought trap. One’s academic achievement is proportional to his endeavor, rather than the sweat he paid. Sticking to the old-school research method with ascetic monks’ style makes no sense. Truly devoted scholars will not be distracted by the cyberworld during their work. The unreliablity of the online information might be criticized. This will be discussed in the parts below.</p>
<p>First, the Internet offers a quick solution for searching. When the researcher would obtain a specific piece of information in the 19th century, it’s practical to walk into a public library and refer to the book index. However, nowadays, the total knowledge of human being have boomed, no one have the capability to fully master all the knowledge in any field. Therefore, the investigator has to turn to the Internet for efficient browsing service. Actually, proper use of the Internet avoids superfluous and ineffective reading, saving the researchers’ energy to creative.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Internet broaden the border of information. Physical mediums of information lack flexibility. An Australian scholar studying Viking history can hardly have access to the collection in the Northern European museums. Digitalized information is easily be accessed online. Knowledge, materials, articles, artworks and data from any country or region, from any cultural context are available for everyone verified. Accordingly, relevant projects, such as CADAL, have been conducted. Only in this way can researchers synthesize a variety of information and produce original ideas. As for the concerned reliability, the open source databases are always identified so that people can decide whether use the material or not. Admittedly, accountability of online information is still on the way, but we should not repel it.</p>
<p>Revolutionarily, the Internet supports the interaction between the researcher and the objective world. Rather than the static paper materials which always are publication and formed years ago, the Internet provides fresh picture of the frontier of the field. Researchers can exchange their notes with their counterparts and get some inspiration from parallel studies, thereby they can make their exploration a dynamic process. In other words, Internet make the discrete studiers become a loose organization. Though it is just a small step forward, it will hugely accelerate the joint scientific research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Internet promote the efficiency, range, and interaction. God will not favor someone who sticks to plow their fields by hand regardless of an available tractor. Never will the Internet spoil the research, oppositely, it will serve as a wheel.</p>

    <title>Chatter:关于CTF的一些想法</title>
    <url>/2023/03/20/Chatter1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>昨天去听了Trinity的讲座，感觉CTF这个东西还是很有趣的。<br>不为了比赛，随便玩一玩也是非常可以的。<br>无奈这一阶段确实没有什么精力去搞。</p>
<p>不过说回来，还是觉得基础的网络安全技术应该是必备技能之一。<br>就好像你出去旅游怎么保管东西被打劫了怎么跑什么的必须要会吧。<br>更何况，（以下和谐内容大家慢慢读）<br>只有你掌握了这个技术（其实还有web技术），你才知道妮友煤油被兼室，现在虢内这个虢氰，这种罔洛煎茶只会层层嘉玛。<br>如果你队浙芳面衣吴锁之，纳聋子兜套道尼投尚勒，尼兜坎补盗。</p>
